# python_NewColorSpace
This is something I have done purely based of a research. The objective was to highlight some subtle feaatures (reresent some sort of disease) using color modification. In another work, a differnt color space whihc can highlight these subtle features by differentianting surrounding colors.

Later on image segmentation like saliency map or other kind of local and global features can easily pick up this differentiation
